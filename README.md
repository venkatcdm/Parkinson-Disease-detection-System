# Parkinson-s-Disease-detection-System

Executed a machine learning project focused on the detection of Parkinson's disease using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
Highlights:
1. Utilized Pandas for loading, cleaning, and extracting features from a CSV dataset.
2. Employed scikit-learn's StandardScaler to ensure consistent scaling between training and testing datasets.
3. Implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with a linear kernel using scikit-learn. The model was trained on a split dataset.
4. Attained an 87% accuracy on both training and testing datasets, providing crucial insights into the model's performance in Parkinson's disease detection.
5.Demonstrated the model's effectiveness in making predictions on new data by standardizing input features and interpreting results.
